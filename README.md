# MyFirstWebsite
This repository contains the first website I have ever made. Starting from scratch, my classmate Pedro José Bauzà and me coded a functional shopping website.  

To run the website, we used an Apache server which had the following specs: 
  + Apache 2.4.25 
  + MariaDB 10.1.38
  + PHP 7.3.7
